abstract: "Abstract This research note uses exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) to understand regional conflict escalation. This study suggests rethinking the use of strict thresholds of conflict in studies of civil war, given that hot spots are predictors of conflict escalation. In the Colombian case, human rights violations hot spots are predictors of higher intensity conflict escalation."
