I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Policy
and Political Economy at the University of Texas at Dallas. I earned a
Master of Science in Applied Economics from the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) with the support of the Fulbright grant.
Before graduating from UIUC, I received a bachelor's degree in
economics from the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú and worked
as an assistant researcher in the Grupo de Analisis para el Desarrollo
(GRADE).  I have co-authored articles published in the Journal of
World Development, the Journal of Development Studies, and the Journal
of Defence and Peace Economics. My research interests focus on
gender-sensitive policies, rural development, peace and conflict
studies, and poverty reduction strategies in Latin America
