abstract: The oil and gas sectors in Colombia are significant components of the Colombian
  economy, attracting approximately 20% of the FDI, and providing almost a fourth
  of total government revenues. These sectors of critical infrastructure have suffered
  systematic targeting from guerrilla internal conflict. For example, the hydrocarbons
  infrastructure was attacked 829 times between 2007 and 2015. With data from the
  Ministry of Defense and data from CINEP (Centro de Investigación y Educación Popular),
  we compare spatial patterns of pipeline attacks with violent activity of the two
  main leftist guerrilla groups, the ELN and the FARC. We use local indicators for
  spatial association (LISA) to determine overlapping among high activity and presence
  (hot spots) of guerrilla presence and pipeline attacks. We identify vulnerable areas
  of the pipeline infrastructure that the government should prioritize for protection,
  and examine if areas of attacks are related to the general presence and activity
  of guerrilla groups or if there is evidence of strategic targeting of the pipelines.
